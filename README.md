  - Sorting
  - Searching
  - Reshaping
  - Arithmetic operations

- Image manipulation functions
  - Image filtering
  - Image resizing
  - Image color transformations
  - Image segmentation

## Installation

To use the scripts and functions in this repository, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Here are examples of how to use some of the functions in this repository:

### Array Manipulation

```python
from array_manipulation import sort_array, search_array

# Sorting an array
arr = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5]
sorted_arr = sort_array(arr)
print("Sorted Array:", sorted_arr)

# Searching for an element in an array
index = search_array(arr, 5)
print("Index of element 5:", index)
```

### Image Manipulation

```python
from image_manipulation import resize_image, apply_filter

# Resizing an image
input_image_path = 'input_image.jpg'
output_image_path = 'output_image.jpg'
resized_image = resize_image(input_image_path, output_image_path, (100, 100))
print("Image resized and saved to", output_image_path)

# Applying a filter to an image
filtered_image = apply_filter(resized_image, 'blur')
print("Filter applied to the image")
```
